        "description": "This DIY mask tutorial calls for a reusable grocery bag made from non-woven polypropylene, similar to the material N95 masks are made of. It also uses pipe cleaners, which allow for an adjustable fit around the nose. Be sure to wash your reusable bag before starting this project. \n\nHere is the pattern used to make this mask: https://makermask.org/masks/surge/\n\nSUBSTITUTES \n\nA paperclip or other wire could be used instead of pipe cleaners. Instead of a reusable grocery bag, you could use cotton fabric. Ribbon, shoelaces or strips of fabric can be used for mask ties. This video shows hand-sewing, but you could try using a sewing machine.\n\nWHY MAKE A MASK?\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that Americans wear cloth masks or other face coverings in public as a preventative measure to help slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.\n\nThe recommendation is a reversal from previous guidelines issued by the agency, which had said that healthy people did not need to wear face coverings. The agency started to rethink those guidelines as more and more evidence showed that asymptomatic people could unwittingly spread the virus.\n\nThough homemade masks don’t offer the protective seal of N95 masks, studies show homemade masks are better than nothing, especially if people find themselves in a confined space like a MAX train or bus. \n\nBeyond the protection they offer to those wearing them, they also reduce the likelihood that people with the virus, who may not be showing symptoms, will spread it to others.\n\nARE HOMEMADE MASKS HELPING?\n\nRead more at The Oregonian/OregonLive: https://www.oregonlive.com/coronavirus/2020/04/are-homemade-masks-helping-for-some-uses-but-theyre-no-replacement-for-proper-equipment-authorities-say.html",

Instead of a reusable grocery bag, you could use cotton fabric. Ribbon, shoelaces or strips of fabric can be used for mask ties. This video shows hand-sewing, but you could try using a sewing machine.\n\nWHY MAKE A MASK?\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that Americans wear cloth masks or other face coverings in public as a preventative measure to help slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.\n\nThe recommendation is a reversal from previous guidelines issued by the agency, which had said that healthy people did not need to wear face coverings. The agency started to rethink those guidelines as more and more evidence showed that asymptomatic people could unwittingly spread the virus.\n\nThough homemade masks don’t offer the protective seal of N95 masks, studies show homemade masks are better than nothing, especially if people find themselves in a confined space like a MAX train or bus. \n\nBeyond the protection they offer to those wearing them, they also reduce the likelihood that people with the virus, who may not be showing symptoms, will spread it to others.\n\nARE HOMEMADE MASKS HELPING?\n\nRead more at The Oregonian/OregonLive: https://www.oregonlive.com/coronavirus/2020/04/are-homemade-masks-helping-for-some-uses-but-theyre-no-replacement-for-proper-equipment-authorities-say.html"

The mask is just to help to stop some of the spread of the coronavirus and also keep you from touching your face.

Please see above for link to more information and how to clean the fabric masks.\nThis new design can also fit over the N95 surgical mask. In doing more researching, Nancy found that 100% cotton, tight weave fabric is the best option.  Nancy is using jersey knit for this mask because it has some stretch. She uses a Tricot interfacing as a filter. After making the mask, make sure you consistently wash it after wearing (see washing instructions in the background information above).\nTo make this no elastic mask, trace the pattern onto pattern making paper. Use the pattern to cut out four layers of the jersey knit (purchase the fabric and interfacing online or use a t-shirt). Take some Tricot interfacing and press onto each layer of jersey knit. A great tip: lay the Tricot interfacing on the pattern piece and press in the center of the jersey knit. Then trim the edges where the interfacing sticks out and press all of the jersey knit pattern piece until the interfacing is attached. Place right sides together and pin. Do the same for the additional two pattern pieces. Sew just the front on both. Open up both sections, put right sides together, butting the seams together and pin all the way around. Sew all the way around leaving an opening on the bottom. Turn the mask right sides out. Take some pins again and pin all the way around the mask. Trim the outside edge of the earpiece and turn over and pin. Top stitch all the way around. The ear holes do not have a finished edge but the jersey knit will not fray. This mask does take a little longer to make.\nThank you for watching! If you have questions, please email Nancy at quiltingwithnancy@gmail.com.",

Nancy along with members of the West Michigan Quilt Guild have been making fabric masks to go over the N95 masks at the request of the local hospitals to have the N95 surgical masks last longer. Please see above for link to more information and how to clean the fabric masks.\nThis new design can also fit over the N95 surgical mask. In doing more researching, Nancy found that 100% cotton, tight weave fabric is the best option.  Nancy is using jersey knit for this mask because it has some stretch. She uses a Tricot interfacing as a filter. After making the mask, make sure you consistently wash it after wearing (see washing instructions in the background information above).\nTo make this no elastic mask, trace the pattern onto pattern making paper. Use the pattern to cut out four layers of the jersey knit (purchase the fabric and interfacing online or use a t-shirt). Take some Tricot interfacing and press onto each layer of jersey knit. A great tip: lay the Tricot interfacing on the pattern piece and press in the center of the jersey knit. Then trim the edges where the interfacing sticks out and press all of the jersey knit pattern piece until the interfacing is attached. Place right sides together and pin. Do the same for the additional two pattern pieces. Sew just the front on both. Open up both sections, put right sides together, butting the seams together and pin all the way around. Sew all the way around leaving an opening on the bottom. Turn the mask right sides out. Take some pins again and pin all the way around the mask. Trim the outside edge of the earpiece and turn over and pin. Top stitch all the way around. The ear holes do not have a finished edge but the jersey knit will not fray. This mask does take a little longer to make.\nThank you for watching! If you have questions, please email Nancy at quiltingwithnancy@gmail.com."

        "description": "Hello all. How to make a face mask with fabric? Today I will be showing how to make a simple DIY face mask with just your preferred cloth with either hair ties, elastics, or rubber bands. No sewing required! I used satin for demonstration purposes.\n\nSince the CDC now recommends us to wear cloth face coverings, I thought this video might be useful. If you do not have any of these materials, you can always use a handkerchief, scarf, or bandana to protect yourself and others.\n\nThis should be quick, easy, and simple. They are also washable. Thank you for stopping by. Please stay safe.",

          "description": "Hello all. How to make a face mask with fabric? Today I will be showing how to make a simple DIY face mask with just your preferred cloth with either hair ties, elastics, or rubber bands. No sewing required! I used satin for demonstration purposes.\n\nSince the CDC now recommends us to wear cloth face coverings, I thought this video might be useful. If you do not have any of these materials, you can always use a handkerchief, scarf, or bandana to protect yourself and others.\n\nThis should be quick, easy, and simple. They are also washable. Thank you for stopping by. Please stay safe."

You may want to consider filti masks one time use, use a swappable filti filter insert, or possibly disinfect by baking at 150° for 30 mins in a humid oven, (add bowl of water.) \n\nI am not a filter or mask scientist. I don't make any claims. You need to research for yourself. \nI have personally only made these lined with cotton & then bound with a soft cotton knit. I have very sensitive skin, so I've never tried the fabric directly against the skin, and I do not recommend wearing the fabric against the skin. Facial skin is sensitive and I'd hate for your sewing work to be in vain. However, the workers at filti wear this fabric as one layer masks against their skin all day with no issues. \n*The details of how I made the mask that passed the fit test:* \nI used one filter layer, and then lined it inner and outer with 100% cotton. This was mainly to give it more structure and to keep the filter cleaner longer. I used a size 9 ballpoint needle and used a stitch length of 1. I bound the edges of the mask with cotton knit.  I did not seal it with glue of any kind, and it passed! \n\nMy Sewing Machine on Amazon: https://amzn.to/39Jndiz \nTo make your own, use my free pdf downloadable pattern that is on my blog: https://www.bridalsewingtechniques.com/blog/2020/mask-template \n\nPre wash, dry, and iron your *cotton* fabrics, as they do shrink. You do not need to prewash filti. You can use tightly woven cotton or T-shirt cotton. T-shirt cotton can be more difficult to sew, so keep that in mind if you are a beginner. It will help if you use a size 9 Ballpoint needle if you are sewing knit.  I recommend that needle for any of these fabrics, actually.  It will make a difference in your ease of sewing. \n\nCorrection: at 5:20 Every seam will be *glued* back over...\nAlso, excuse my sniffing!  I have horrible allergies, and therefore do not normally record this time of year at all. It was very difficult for my to do the voice over work on this, and it took many takes. \n\nAt the time of this writing, the CDC recommends 2 layers of tightly woven cotton for face mask material. \nIf you would like to research filter fabric or see the fabric that I used in this video see this link: https://filti.com/product/filti-face-mask-material/   I am not affiliated with them or officially recommend them.  I just personally really liked their product. Please note: Filti fabric color may vary from what is shown.  They are currently shipping white.

Du siehst es hier in einer englischer Übersetzung und mit deutschem Untertitel.\n\nIn jedem Land existieren andere Regeln und Bestimmungen.

Ich bin aber keine professionelle Lehrerin und habe auch keine handwerkliche Ausbildung. In den Anleitungen arbeite ich mit Werkzeugen, die für Ungeübte und Kinder gefährlich sein können. Treffe bitte, bei allem was du nachmachst, die nötigen Sicherheitsvorkehrungen. Mir ist bewusst, dass das jetzt sehr abstrakt klingt, aber wenn du beispielsweise noch nie an einer Nähmaschine genäht hast, solltest du dich erste mit ihr vertraut machen. Danke. Bleib gesund!"
