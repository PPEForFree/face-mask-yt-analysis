I'm currently working to obtain actual filtration data for shop towel material to determine how this design compares to commercial masks.  My fingers are crossed that we'll be able to recommend a version of this to healthcare workers.\n\nUPDATE: If making these for others, be sure to do it on a sterile surface, with clean hands, and while wearing a mask yourself.  We make them outside or in the garage, and wrap them immediately in saran wrap, then pack them in groups of 10 in paper bags to maintain a safe level of cleanliness. \n\nUPDATE 4/3:  Material info (copied from comments section):\nPhillip Clapp  4/2/2020\nGreat video! I’m a toxicologist at UNC Chapel Hill and I’m currently testing how well N95 masks function after sterilization. I’ve made a bunch of your masks (with rubber bands and tie strings) and I’m going to test how effective they are agains virus-sized particles tomorrow. I’ll let you know what I find. Thanks!\n\nPhillip Clapp 4/3/2020\nI tested 4 versions of the Shop Towel Mask today; mask 1) exactly according to the video, mask 2) long rubber bands on each side that could be tied behind the neck, mask 3) shoe strings instead of rubber bands so you could tie high and low like a surgeon’s mask, and mask 4) stacking two sheets together (double ply) with the long rubber bands around the neck. All of the masks were worn by the same individual (67yo healthy Caucasian male) and mask effectiveness was measured while, bending at the waist for 50sec, reading aloud for 30 sec, looking left and right for 30 seconds, and looking up and down for 30 seconds. Here’s what we found (I’ll refer to masks as 1-4 as described above):\n\nMask 1) 54.32% +/- 5.97% effective\nMask 2) 53.88% +/- 7.67% effective\nMask 3) 41.91% +/- 8.46% effective\nMask 4) 73.97% +/- 6.59% effective\n\nSo, mask 4 (2 pieces of paper towel together) performed the best. And while 73.97% may not seem very effective, mask 4 was actually better than standard surgical masks with ear loops (38.93% effective), a homemade cotton mask (53.17% effective), and surgical masks with tie strings (71.50% effective). So here is the big thing to remember with all masks, fit is everything! Even an N95 without a good seal is ineffective. The other thing to remember is that trying to breath through a thick mask can be tough on your heart and lungs. This could put elderly people and those with preexisting cardiopulmonary conditions at risk. Don’t wear a mask that makes you feel like you’re suffocating and avoid wearing any mask for really long periods of time. Take care of yourself and stay safe. Trust science and we’ll get through this mess. Not really a plug but I will post relevant COVID info and inhalation tox info on Twitter @UNCtoxicology\nThanks! \nPhillip Clapp, PhD\n\nVideo description:\nA DIY no-sew mask easily made with supplies typically found in the home.\n\n\n\n\ncovid-19, mask, surgical mask, corona virus,",

        "description": "This is the link to the tutorial on my blog where you can find a sewing pattern for the fabric face mask\nhttps://www.ageberry.com/sew-fabric-face-mask-free-pattern/ \n \n\nCut 2 front pieces of the mask with good fabric scissors. \nCut also 2 pieces of lining. (Remember, lining pieces should be a bit smaller than the main pieces). \nYou have to cut out 2 mirrored pieces, left and right. Their shape is exactly the same but they are not identical. They are cut in opposite directions because they are symmetrical mirror images of each other. \nStep 5\nNow we are going to sew darts.\nCut the darts on the paper pattern pieces. Don’t cut them on fabric pieces of course. \nDraw darts on fabric pieces using a fabric marker. We have 2 front pieces of the mask and 2 lining pieces. All of them have darts. \nFold each piece in half and pin preparing the darts for stitching. \nSew all the darts. Start sewing a dart from the edge of the pattern to the center. Backstitch in the beginning but don’t backstitch in the end. Tie the threads at the end of the dart and cut them. Cut also the other thread tails.\nStep 6. \nBaste 2 main pieces of the mask right sides together (by hand sewing), seam allowances are ⅜” (or 1 cm)  and check how it fits around the nose. It’s very easy to do. After that make necessary adjustments to the pattern. The mask shouldn’t be loose around the nose.  \nI noticed that for the correct fit the side seams should be a bit smaller than your ears. If the sides (in the finished mask) are bigger than the ears the mask will not sit close to your face at the sides. \nIf you need to make the mask smaller for a child remember that the pattern has ⅜” seam allowances up and down and at the sides, so cut accordingly. \nAfter you are done with fitting pin 2 front pieces and 2 lining pieces right sides together like you see in the video. Stitch the middle seams and press seam allowances open on the front piece and on the lining. \nStep 7\nI see that the surgical masks have a thin metal insert for better fitting around the nose which it increases its effectiveness in protecting against the penetration of microorganisms. So I took one from a used mask. You can do the same. It provides a snug fit to the nose and you can change the area of ​​contact depending on the size of the nose. \nMake a small casing for the metal nose insert. I used a piece of ribbon for this. \nPin it to the lining piece at the distance a little bit more than ⅜” (1cm) from the fabric edge and stitch. Make two seams to form a casing for inserting the metal piece.  \nYou have to attach the ribbon to the right side of the lining piece which will cover your nose.\nStep 8. \nPin the front piece and the lining right sides together. Make sure the ribbon insert for the nose is placed up if you have a special pattern on your fabric. For example, I didn’t want my Unicorns upside down on my mask.\nMake only 2 seams: one up and one down the mask. LEAVE ABOUT 1 INCH (or 2 - 2.5 CM) WITHOUT STITCHES ON ALL SIDES.  You will see later why. \nALSO LEAVE OPEN  around 2 INCHES (or 5 CM) IN THE  BOTTOM SEAM FOR TURNING THE MASK RIGHT SIDE OUT. \nStep 9\nOk, you see that I made 2 seams up and down and I have 1 inch not stitched on all sides and I also have the opening for turning the mask right side out. \nThese seams are not straight, they are curved so I have to make small cuts close to the seams so when I turn the mask right side out there will be no pulling in the seams. \nNow we need to stitch the sides. But I want to make casings for elastic loops on both sides. \nSo for this fold the seam allowances as in the video (image below) and make the side seams. \nStep 10\nCut the seam allowances at the side seams close to stitches. \nTurn the mask right side out. Smooth every corner. Baste the mask around all edges and press with an iron. \nTopstitch the bottom edge only (you will need to close the opening). I didn’t want to topstitch the upper edge because there is the ribbon insert.  \nRemove the basting thread.\nStep 11.\nSo, we made casings for the elastic loops. \nNow we need to insert elastic for the mask. Elastic loops make the process of putting the mask on as simple as possible. \nElastic has to be very thin and soft so it doesn’t make any discomfort for the ears. \nI have this very nice elastic, it’s silver and would look great with this fabric. But I see it’s a little bit too hard so I decided to go with less fancy regular elastic which is softer. \nInsert the elastic using a safety pin. Measure the elastic around your ears so the mask sits comfortably - not very tight, so it doesn’t pull your ears, but not very loose also. Make a knot when you are done and pull the knot inside the mask so it’s not visible. \nStep 12. \nThe last step is fixing the elastic inside the mask so the sides stay flat around the face. I just made big zigzag stitches at the sides. After you are done insert the metal piece for the nose.",

My research is below - it’s up to you to decide what you will do.\n\nAccording to an article in the NY Times, scientists have been testing different materials for making face mask filters:\n\n\"Scientists around the country have taken it upon themselves to identify everyday materials that do a better job of filtering microscopic particles. In recent tests, HEPA furnace filters scored well, as did vacuum cleaner bags, layers of 600-count pillowcases and fabric similar to flannel pajamas. Stacked coffee filters had medium scores. Scarves and bandanna material had the lowest scores, but still captured a small percentage of particles.\" (Source of the NY Times article: https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-homemade-mask-material-DIY-face-mask-ppe.html ) \n\nOther things to keep in mind:\n\n- I don’t know whether or not these filters are effective. We had a need for something like this,  materials are scarce, and I did my best to meet our needs.\n\n- I do not believe they are harmful. I checked with the manufacturer of Filtrete air filters, and these do not contain fiberglass (see the entire response below). But I do not know about other brands or types of HEPA filters.\n\n- There are probably better options, but it’s hard to find a lot of materials right now that might work. I made do with what was available to me.\n\nSo please take this video with a grain of salt. Use your best judgement. If you feel it would work for you - great. If not, that’s fine too. :)\n\nI emailed Filtrete to see if their filters contain fiberglass, and here is the answer I got: \n\n“Our filters are made from Polypropylene plastic fibers and strands, adhesive, paperboard, and for some filters, metal wire. There is no Fiberglass in our Filters. However, our Filtrete brand products are designed to be used in your home and your HVAC systems. The filter media in a Filtrete brand filter performs very differently than an approved N95 respirator or mask. It cannot achieve the fit or performance of a mask or N95 respirator and modifying the furnace filter may damage the material. 3M does not recommend or support the use of a Filtrete brand filter to make a mask or respirator.”\n\nBased on this, I hope you find a solution that works for you and your family.\n\nHere is more information about this in a blog post:\nHere are my recommendations for face mask patterns, including the Olson Mask Pattern: https://www.sewcanshe.com/blog/5-free-diy-face-mask-tutorials-using-fabric: https://www.sewcanshe.com/blog/how-to-make-a-face-mask-filter-with-hepa-fabric-video-tutorial\n\nBecause uninformed individuals keep telling us that these filters contain fiberglass - something I already researched - I am disabling comments.",

Try to make the mask's size is smaller, the earloops are longer and pin them at 4 corners of the mask like a real surgical mask, like that air will go in more (standard surgical mask is quite loose and comfortable, the best way is just measure the same size)\nOr you just remove plastic layer and add more tissue paper, if it can't protect you 99% .it also can protect 50%. It's better than nothing \nI know that surgical masks should be used for sickness people for prevent infection to others, but now day very hard to find, everywhere sold out, those who got infected virus also no mask to wear....\nI believe that after you see my video and watched other videos about DIY face mask, you will make your own face mask better than me, the safest and most comfortable masks\nHopefully it's useful \n All you need:\n- Clear plastic bag (waterproof layer)\n- Tissue paper \n- Disposable Nappy liner (it completely clean just like tissue)/ or wet tissue after it is dried (outer layer of mask)\n- rubber band/ elastic fabric band (earloop)\n- Stapler\nSubscribe my channel to watch more new videos, thank you again",
