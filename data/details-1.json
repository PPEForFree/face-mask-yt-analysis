We do say this in the video ;)\n\nCan I get the twist ties for the nose clips from you? Yes, we have made them available for free with a small shipping charge to cover our packaging and postage costs. You can order up to 200 in one order right here: https://shop.quiltaddictsanonymous.com/product/twist-tie-for-medical-mask-nose-clip-alternative/\n\nIf you want a bias tape maker, we have a new tool made in the U.S. that is perfect for mask making and reorderable. You can get them at this link: https://shop.quiltaddictsanonymous.com/product/bias-tape-maker-1-inch/\n\nWe have made available some mask kits made with 100% quilt shop quality fabric. Check them out at the links below while supplies last.\n\nSurgical Style Mask Kit for 12 Masks: https://shop.quiltaddictsanonymous.com/product/surgical-style-mask-kit-for-12-masks/\n\nN95 Style Mask Kit for 12 Masks: https://shop.quiltaddictsanonymous.com/product/n95-style-mask-kit-for-12-masks/\n\nAlso, we now have access to elastic.

The four main distributors to quilt shops in the U.S. are all out and it is going to be a bit before they can get more.\n\nSo I created this video to show you how to convert ANY mask pattern that uses elastic into one that uses ties. The first half goes through the steps you need to take to convert the standard surgical style mask from elastic to ties. \n\nThe second goes over how to do it on an N95-style mask that has a a curved top and pocket for a filter. The second half starts at 12:40.\n\nJust a reminder that your best defense against the COVID-19 is to STAY HOME!

For those of us who sew, we can band together and make a huge difference in this time of need!\nIn times of emergency, the CDC allows fabric masks to be used when a shortage takes place. You can read more from the CDC on this subject here: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/ppe-strategy/face-masks.html\n\nIn this sewing tutorial, we will be sewing a standard face mask with elastic ear hooks.\n\nHomemade face masks can be donated to be used in hospitals, doctors’ offices, and retirement homes. This relieves the strain of a mask shortage and allows N95 masks to be used for COVID-19 and critical situations requiring PPE.\nWhile wearing a homemade face mask will not prevent someone from catching Covid-19, it can decrease the spread of large particles when someone sneezes. It can be used in cases of the flu, cold and other airborne illnesses. Just a reminder that these masks should only be worn if you are sick or caring for someone who is sick.\nAll face masks should be washed and sterilized before use and cleaned again after becoming damp or moist. Color-safe bleach like Clorox 2 or Purex 2 can be used to sanitize with hot water.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR A PRINTABLE VERSION OF THIS TUTORIAL: https://sweetredpoppy.com/how-to-sew-a-surgical-face-mask/\n\nCONNECT WITH KIMBERLY AND SWEET RED POPPY:\nSubscribe to my channel here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyJNp6DNzm56XrPppI8r67Q\nFollow me here:\nBlog: sweetredpoppy.com\nFacebook Page: https://www.facebook.com/sweetredpoppy/\nFacebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/2128534807407840/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/sweetredpoppy/\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/kimberlycoffin/",

Watch Jenny's DIY Fabric Tie Face Mask tutorial here: https://bit.ly/FabricTieFaceMask_yt20\n\nNOTE: Please reach out to your local healthcare providers and first responders before making any masks. This video is intended for general education and informational purposes and should not be relied upon for medical advice. \n\nMom (Jenny Doan) had a great idea yesterday.  She wanted to do something to help with this coronavirus situation we're in.  And while a face mask will not prevent you from getting sick (social distance people!) it will help you from spreading germs you may have, and is a very helpful thing to have if you or someone you know may feel sick or be around sick people. \n\nSo mom sat down and whipped this out on her cell phone because she's amazing.\n\nHope this is helpful, you may check with your local hospitals and response people, they may want you to make them a few if they are in need.  You can add a few more layers of fabric for added filtration if you need to as well.  Hope this helps!\n\nStay healthy!!\n\n-------\n\nThe measurements (these may need to be customized for best fit): \n\nAdult Mask\n2 rectangles of fabric - 6\" x 9\"\n2 pieces of 1/4\" elastic - 7\"\n\nChild Mask\n2 rectangles of fabric 5\" x 7.5\"\n2 pieces of 1/4\" elastic - 7\" (but will need to be checked for fit)\n\n-------\n@missouriquiltco \n#missouristarquiltco #diyfacemask #howtosewafacemask",

She wanted to do something to help with this coronavirus situation we're in.  And while a face mask will not prevent you from getting sick (social distance people!) it will help you from spreading germs you may have, and is a very helpful thing to have if you or someone you know may feel sick or be around sick people. \n\nSo mom sat down and whipped this out on her cell phone because she's amazing.\n\nHope this is helpful, you may check with your local hospitals and response people, they may want you to make them a few if they are in need.  You can add a few more layers of fabric for added filtration if you need to as well.  Hope this helps!\n\nStay healthy!!\n\n-------\n\nThe measurements (these may need to be customized for best fit): \n\nAdult Mask\n2 rectangles of fabric - 6\" x 9\"\n2 pieces of 1/4\" elastic - 7\"\n\nChild Mask\n2 rectangles of fabric 5\" x 7.5\"\n2 pieces of 1/4\" elastic - 7\" (but will need to be checked for fit)\n\n-------\n@missouriquiltco \n#missouristarquiltco #diyfacemask #howtosewafacemask"

        "description": "Want to make face masks but you don't have access to any elastic. NO WORRIES! This pattern has been simplified and modified so you can sew up a face mask in no time at all, and upcycle a t-shirt at the same time.\n\nMasks can be used for various situations: Outdoor pollen allergies, indoors, grocery stores, parks, nail salons, and AS A REMINDER TO NOT TOUCH YOUR FACE!!!!!\n\nThese masks are NOT MEDICAL MASKS, are NOT N95, and are NOT FDA approved.\nThere are no claims stating this will prevent the spread of COVID-19.\n\nUPDATED POCKET OPENING INSTRUCTIONS!!!!\n********************************************\nInstead of placing the filter opening in the middle of the mask, place it just 1/2 inch down from the top fold. Top stitch 1/2 inch from top fold to create the wire casing. \n********************************************\nThis tutorial and pattern includes a pocket access in case you want to add a filter, a wired nose clip and stretchy knit ties. \n\nItems & Supplies Needed:\nFABRIC \n\nSCISSORS\n\nPINS/CLIPS (OPTIONAL)\nhttps://amzn.to/3bx7Eey\n\nROTARY CUTTER SET\nhttps://amzn.to/2K2yPlG\n\nSEWING MACHINE\n\nCraft Pipe Cleaners/ or BAG TWIST TIES\nhttps://amzn.to/3dDDZCm\n\nIRON\n\nUPCYCLED T SHIRT/ OR KNIT FABRIC\n\n*******If you don't want to make your own, I have finished masks available in my ETSY shop.

          "description": "Want to make face masks but you don't have access to any elastic. NO WORRIES! This pattern has been simplified and modified so you can sew up a face mask in no time at all, and upcycle a t-shirt at the same time.\n\nMasks can be used for various situations: Outdoor pollen allergies, indoors, grocery stores, parks, nail salons, and AS A REMINDER TO NOT TOUCH YOUR FACE!!!!!\n\nThese masks are NOT MEDICAL MASKS, are NOT N95, and are NOT FDA approved.\nThere are no claims stating this will prevent the spread of COVID-19.\n\nUPDATED POCKET OPENING INSTRUCTIONS!!!!\n********************************************\nInstead of placing the filter opening in the middle of the mask, place it just 1/2 inch down from the top fold. Top stitch 1/2 inch from top fold to create the wire casing. \n********************************************\nThis tutorial and pattern includes a pocket access in case you want to add a filter, a wired nose clip and stretchy knit ties. \n\nItems & Supplies Needed:\nFABRIC \n\nSCISSORS\n\nPINS/CLIPS (OPTIONAL)\nhttps://amzn.to/3bx7Eey\n\nROTARY CUTTER SET\nhttps://amzn.to/2K2yPlG\n\nSEWING MACHINE\n\nCraft Pipe Cleaners/ or BAG TWIST TIES\nhttps://amzn.to/3dDDZCm\n\nIRON\n\nUPCYCLED T SHIRT/ OR KNIT FABRIC\n\n*******If you don't want to make your own, I have finished masks available in my ETSY shop.

Health providers experiencing shortages, who have handmade masks can use them on lower-risk patients allowing N95s to be reserved for emergency cases.\n\nCONNECT WITH KIMBERLY AND SWEET RED POPPY:\nSubscribe to my channel here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyJNp6DNzm56XrPppI8r67Q\nFollow me here:\nBlog: sweetredpoppy.com\nFacebook Page: https://www.facebook.com/sweetredpoppy/\nFacebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/2128534807407840/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/sweetredpoppy/\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/kimberlycoffin/"

        "description": "READ ALL OF THIS! \nTHIS IS NOT A RELACEMENT FOR THE N95 MASK!  I do not make any claims that this mask will prevent illness. This mask is to be used as a measure to protect others around you in situations where physical distancing is difficult to maintain. It keeps in your droplets and keeps you from touching your face.\nIt is up to YOU to PRACTICE PROPER SAFETY HYGIENE and DISTANCING. We can do this!\n\nThis is an INTERMEDIATE SEWING project. You need to know how to run a sewing machine and basic sewing skills. I do use a serger, but it is not necessary if you have zigzag on your sewing machine or pinking shears. I am using an Industrial machine that only has straight stitch.\n\nThis video has very detailed, but easy instructions, so you will have SUCCESS ON YOUR FIRST TRY. Start- to-finish for one mask is 15-20 min. This pattern is versatile in style, fits both men and women, and includes 4 different style options, with or without elastic. Because the elastic is NOT sewn in, it is easily replaced. I do not have written instructions.\nThis video is hearing-impaired friendly.\n\nThis mask has a filter pocket to hold a non-woven fabric, such as meltblown fabric, coffee filter, which is what the CDC suggests, paper towel, blue shop towel, etc. The aluminum nose wire is adjustable, comfortable and keeps your glasses from fogging up (Big Bonus).\n100% cotton fabric means it is machine washable (in a mesh bag), breathable and very well made.\nYou can get 2 masks from one fat quarter (22\"x 18\"). A fat quarter is popular with quilters and is 1/4 of an opened up yard of fabric, not 1/4 yard cut from the bolt..\n\nFILTER SIZE:  This mask is to PROTECT OTHERS FROM YOU, so make the filter big enough to cover your mouth and nose. Do not restrict your breathing.\nDO NOT use a mask on a child under 2 years of age p/the CDC website.\n \nEach time you wear it, you must discard the filter and wash the mask. ALWAYS HANDLE THE MASK AS IF IT'S CONTAMINATED after you wear it and wash your hands immediately.\n\nI washed one, in a mesh lingerie bag, with a big load of blankets, with hot water and dried in the dryer.

          "description": "READ ALL OF THIS! \nTHIS IS NOT A RELACEMENT FOR THE N95 MASK!  I do not make any claims that this mask will prevent illness. This mask is to be used as a measure to protect others around you in situations where physical distancing is difficult to maintain. It keeps in your droplets and keeps you from touching your face.\nIt is up to YOU to PRACTICE PROPER SAFETY HYGIENE and DISTANCING. We can do this!\n\nThis is an INTERMEDIATE SEWING project. You need to know how to run a sewing machine and basic sewing skills. I do use a serger, but it is not necessary if you have zigzag on your sewing machine or pinking shears. I am using an Industrial machine that only has straight stitch.\n\nThis video has very detailed, but easy instructions, so you will have SUCCESS ON YOUR FIRST TRY. Start- to-finish for one mask is 15-20 min. This pattern is versatile in style, fits both men and women, and includes 4 different style options, with or without elastic. Because the elastic is NOT sewn in, it is easily replaced. I do not have written instructions.\nThis video is hearing-impaired friendly.\n\nThis mask has a filter pocket to hold a non-woven fabric, such as meltblown fabric, coffee filter, which is what the CDC suggests, paper towel, blue shop towel, etc. The aluminum nose wire is adjustable, comfortable and keeps your glasses from fogging up (Big Bonus).\n100% cotton fabric means it is machine washable (in a mesh bag), breathable and very well made.\nYou can get 2 masks from one fat quarter (22\"x 18\"). A fat quarter is popular with quilters and is 1/4 of an opened up yard of fabric, not 1/4 yard cut from the bolt..\n\nFILTER SIZE:  This mask is to PROTECT OTHERS FROM YOU, so make the filter big enough to cover your mouth and nose. Do not restrict your breathing.\nDO NOT use a mask on a child under 2 years of age p/the CDC website.\n \nEach time you wear it, you must discard the filter and wash the mask.

My brother-in-law Chad (who is a respiratory therapist at the hospital I was born at) just called me about making face masks because they are running out at the hospital. He made it very clear that some sort of mask is better than no mask. I’ve researched the best materials to use per the CDC guidelines and the Cambridge University study and created a sewing pattern that can be cut by hand with my free printable PDF or on a Cricut Explore or Maker with my free SVG cut file. These Cricut face mask patterns use common household materials you probably already have and can be made with slots for filters, adjustable ties, and a wire to fit snugly around your nose. Help me sew DIY face masks for our essential hospital workers on the front line!\n\nImportant: These DIY face masks do not replace the need for N95 masks. Rather, they are a last resort when no N95 masks are available. Some mask is better than no mask at all. If you have an N95 mask and want to learn how to make a cover to extend its life, let me know and if there’s enough interest I’ll make a pattern for that, too!\n\nThis DIY face mask pattern has several important features, all requested by my favorite respiratory therapist. Most of the features are optional, so you can keep it simple with just two layers and some ties, or go for full-featured version with three layers, a filter, and an adjustable nose guard.

Please note, this is my personal choice and it worked for me while I used for yard work, but you have to try it if you think it’s work for you or not. So don’t wear or make it if you don’t think its safe for you!!!\nThe size I fold based on my face size, you can always adjust the length to fit you comfortably. \nYou’ll need:\n1 bandana ( 100% cotton or Non woven fabric) size 21” x 21” and up \n2 ponytail holders \nFilter- can be purchased at Walmart or Amazon . In this video I use envirocare vacuum cleaner bag... \nChoose the filter that suitable for your need. This brand is for my personal choice because I always have them for my vacuum cleaner ( new)\n\nPlease follow CDC guidelines, Wash your hands often, Social distancing, Stay home if possible,, take care of yourself and others.
