        "description": "(19 Apr 2020) LEAD IN : \r\nNuns in a remote Russian convent are making face masks to tackle the shortage of protective wear during the COVID-19 outbreak.\r\n\r\nSTORY-LINE:\r\nThis is a tightly run production line. \r\nEveryone knows their job and works as a team to produce around 100 face masks each day. \r\nThe workers are nuns who live at a remote Russian Orthodox monastery in Russia's Yaroslav region.\r\nThey're doing their bit in the effort to stop the spread of the COVID-19 virus. \r\nAbbess Erotiyida, Head of St. Nicholas-Solbinsky monastery explains that the monastery is at the heart of the local community. \r\n \"The idea is very simple - we need to help people. Because if people need them (face masks) and pharmacies cannot provide those means of self-protection, we are always here. The monastery always responds to peoples' needs.  Our monastery is focused on people,  we educate children, we have a college and a school here. Because we are in the remote place people gravitate towards our monastery, all villages come to use with any problems, that's why we are promptly reacting to all needs. The church is always next to people, that's what the history tells us. Our monastery too, during WWII was helping to make clothes for the army,\" she says.\r\nThe sisters are helped by local volunteers and students of the school based in the convent grounds. \r\nSister Tamara says that each of them is an expert in their role: \"We sew masks in the sewing workshop of the monastery.

          "description": "(19 Apr 2020) LEAD IN : \r\nNuns in a remote Russian convent are making face masks to tackle the shortage of protective wear during the COVID-19 outbreak.\r\n\r\nSTORY-LINE:\r\nThis is a tightly run production line. \r\nEveryone knows their job and works as a team to produce around 100 face masks each day. \r\nThe workers are nuns who live at a remote Russian Orthodox monastery in Russia's Yaroslav region.\r\nThey're doing their bit in the effort to stop the spread of the COVID-19 virus. \r\nAbbess Erotiyida, Head of St. Nicholas-Solbinsky monastery explains that the monastery is at the heart of the local community. \r\n \"The idea is very simple - we need to help people. Because if people need them (face masks) and pharmacies cannot provide those means of self-protection, we are always here. The monastery always responds to peoples' needs.  Our monastery is focused on people,  we educate children, we have a college and a school here. Because we are in the remote place people gravitate towards our monastery, all villages come to use with any problems, that's why we are promptly reacting to all needs. The church is always next to people, that's what the history tells us. Our monastery too, during WWII was helping to make clothes for the army,\" she says.\r\nThe sisters are helped by local volunteers and students of the school based in the convent grounds. \r\nSister Tamara says that each of them is an expert in their role: \"We sew masks in the sewing workshop of the monastery.
