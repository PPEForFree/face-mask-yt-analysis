        "description": "Since the CDC has recommended that all Americans should wear a face mask or face covering while in public, this video offers step-by-step instructions for how to make fabric face masks for yourself and your family without a sewing machine and without elastic. There are two quick and easy ways to do this: the first is a low-sew method that only requires fabric and a needle and thread. The second alternative is a no-sew method that uses safety pins instead of a needle and thread. Both methods use fabric ties instead of elastic and will allow you to make face coverings to keep you and your family safe during the COVID-19 crisis. \n\nTo make a pleated cotton mask: https://youtu.be/VgHrnS6n4iA\nTo make a shaped denim face mask: https://youtu.be/ZCITvWle-Bc\nTips & Tricks for Making Non-Surgical Protective Face Masks: https://youtu.be/BnhePGv0gmQ\nLink to Shop All Mask Making Supplies: bit.ly/MaskMakingSupplies\nLink to Cotton Fabric: https://bit.ly/CottonForMasks\nLink to Elastic: https://bit.ly/MaskElastic\n\nIf you'd like to join our Make to Give efforts by making protective masks to support our medical community, visit http://www.joann.com/maketogive or visit your local JOANN store to pick up a free kit of supplies.

        "description": "Makers have asked for a pattern to sew homemade surgical masks for hospitals. Orders for the standard disposable masks used in hospitals are back-ordered, due to the high demand for protective equipment.\n\nSo, because of these supply concerns, many hospitals across the country have requested homemade surgical masks as an emergency stopgap measure.\n\nAccording to the CDC, fabric masks are a crisis response option when other supplies have been exhausted.\n\nThe DIY pattern in this post will teach you to make a standard pleated face mask with elastic ear loops. This pattern has 2 layers of fabric, and an internal pocket in which you can add additional layers of disposable filtration material if desired.\n\nIf you can’t find or don’t want to use elastic, there are also ideas for using fabric ties instead.\n\nA printable version of these pattern instructions is available at the bottom of this post: https://sarahmaker.com/how-to-sew-a-surgical-face-mask-for-hospitals-free-pattern/\n\n!! Check the updated instructions in the blog post, because we've changed some of the measurements to improve the design.\n\nI strongly caution you before you spend time sewing these masks:\n\nFollow the CDC guidelines as the situation develops.\nContact your local hospital and clinic to ensure that they are accepting masks, and that any masks you make will meet their individual guidelines.",

There is a huge shortage of face masks for the medical community and these diy face masks could really help. This pleated style face mask is very comfortable and easily fits a wide range of people. This reusable fabric mask is made of soft cotton fabric and soft nylon for way pieces which makes it very comfortable to wear. These diy face masks are perfect for going grocery shopping or running essential errands.

        "description": "Get the FREE Printable PDF Pattern Here: http://eatpraycreate.com/2020/03/diy-face-mask-tutorial-and-pattern.html\n*Print at 100%, square should be slightly bigger than 1\" x1\"\n*To make other sizes please see the instructions on the pattern page - including kids sizes!!\n\nPlease Note: This mask will not protect against respiratory illnesses.\n\nI have been working hard to design a mask that fits snug around the nose and mouth for added protection. This is the perfect mask to help keep germs away and protect you from touching your face. It is designed with a snug fit and flexible nose piece. Great for making for your family or for your local hospital since supplies are running low during this time. It is Re-usable (clean between uses), washable, and reversible. \n\nSupplies:\n- 100% Cotton Fabric Scraps (Pre-washed and dried)\n- Elastic (or Soft Elastic for around the head) –   https://amzn.to/2VJOITu or https://amzn.to/3auRFwk\n- Flexible Garden Tie (aka soft plant tie) - https://amzn.to/39vV6mf\n- Wire Cutters\n- Sewing Clips or Pins - https://amzn.to/2URgNId\n- Scissors\n- Sewing Machine and Thread\n\nNOTE: Cut women’s elastic to 5” (small) and men’s elastic to 6” (Large)\n\nNEW UPDATE:\nCheck out my latest video on how to add a FILTER POCKET and HEAD STRAPS or TIES to this face mask:\nhttps://youtu.be/-VOaPe1pWd0\n\nFAQ's:\n- Kid sizes now available on the pattern link.\n- Printable instructions are coming soon!\n- Seam Allowance is about 3/8\" I try to do as small as my machine will allow.\n- The pleat on the side is about 1\" total - 1/2\" on each side then laid down to sew. For larger size make it a little smaller, for kids sizes make it a little smaller as well.\n- Ignore the 1\" square on the pattern, that was for sizing purposes but print according to the percentage you need for the size mask you wish to make.\n- If you don't have a printer try opening the pattern on your computer screen, brighten your screen and trace the pattern on a thin piece of paper. These are about how much distance is between each section of the pattern (for regular size):  Top 5″ (including swoop), Top nose to chin 9″, Chin to Jaw 3-1/2″, Jaw to upper ear 4″ \n- Removable Nose Wire Instructions are coming soon as well!!\n- 1 Adult mask takes about 1/4 yard of fabric.\n\n\n*This is not a sponsored post.

          "description": "Get the FREE Printable PDF Pattern Here: http://eatpraycreate.com/2020/03/diy-face-mask-tutorial-and-pattern.html\n*Print at 100%, square should be slightly bigger than 1\" x1\"\n*To make other sizes please see the instructions on the pattern page - including kids sizes!!\n\nPlease Note: This mask will not protect against respiratory illnesses.\n\nI have been working hard to design a mask that fits snug around the nose and mouth for added protection. This is the perfect mask to help keep germs away and protect you from touching your face. It is designed with a snug fit and flexible nose piece. Great for making for your family or for your local hospital since supplies are running low during this time. It is Re-usable (clean between uses), washable, and reversible. \n\nSupplies:\n- 100% Cotton Fabric Scraps (Pre-washed and dried)\n- Elastic (or Soft Elastic for around the head) –   https://amzn.to/2VJOITu or https://amzn.to/3auRFwk\n- Flexible Garden Tie (aka soft plant tie) - https://amzn.to/39vV6mf\n- Wire Cutters\n- Sewing Clips or Pins - https://amzn.to/2URgNId\n- Scissors\n- Sewing Machine and Thread\n\nNOTE: Cut women’s elastic to 5” (small) and men’s elastic to 6” (Large)\n\nNEW UPDATE:\nCheck out my latest video on how to add a FILTER POCKET and HEAD STRAPS or TIES to this face mask:\nhttps://youtu.be/-VOaPe1pWd0\n\nFAQ's:\n- Kid sizes now available on the pattern link.\n- Printable instructions are coming soon!\n- Seam Allowance is about 3/8\" I try to do as small as my machine will allow.\n- The pleat on the side is about 1\" total - 1/2\" on each side then laid down to sew. For larger size make it a little smaller, for kids sizes make it a little smaller as well.\n- Ignore the 1\" square on the pattern, that was for sizing purposes but print according to the percentage you need for the size mask you wish to make.\n- If you don't have a printer try opening the pattern on your computer screen, brighten your screen and trace the pattern on a thin piece of paper. These are about how much distance is between each section of the pattern (for regular size):  Top 5″ (including swoop), Top nose to chin 9″, Chin to Jaw 3-1/2″, Jaw to upper ear 4″ \n- Removable Nose Wire Instructions are coming soon as well!!\n- 1 Adult mask takes about 1/4 yard of fabric.\n\n\n*This is not a sponsored post.

As a community of crafters, this is a great way we can band together and make a huge difference in this time of need! \n\nWhile handmade fabric face masks are NOT a substitution for N95 masks, you can read more from the CDC here on the use of homemade masks here: \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/ppe-strategy/face-masks.html\n\nIn addition to helping medical staff during critical shortages, these masks can be used at home as well. While wearing homemade face masks will not prevent against catching a respiratory illness, if worn by someone who is sick they can help reduce the spread of large particles when they sneeze or cough. \n\n*** PRODUCTS USED ***\n* Fabric: 100% Cotton\n* Juki TL2000 Qi: https://amzn.to/2MYdOZu\n* Aurifil 50wt Thread: https://amzn.to/33gN1Af\n* Oliso Pro Smart Iron: https://amzn.to/2ZbppJE\n* Scissors: https://amzn.to/2tvesWm\n* Wonder Clips: https://amzn.to/2tr1s4e\n* 1/4\" Cluck Cluck Sew Tape:  http://bit.ly/2B6rzS8\n\n*** QUILT on the Wall Behind me ***\nVintage Spring Quilt Pattern: http://bit.ly/2IMAGw2\n\n**** Shop ERICA'S SEWING FAVORITES Here! **** \nhttps://www.amazon.com/shop/ericaarndt\n\n****  FIND ME HERE **** \nEmail me: erica@confessionsofahomeschooler.com\neCourses: http://go.confessionsofahomeschooler.com\nWebsite: http://www.confessionsofahomeschooler.com\nStore: http://store.confessionsofahomeschooler.com/\nCOAH Homeschool Community: https://community.confessionsofahomeschooler.com\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ericaarndt/ \nYouTube Channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/EricasHomeschool\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/ConfessionsofaHomeschooler\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/ericahomeschool\nPinterest: http://pinterest.com/ericahomeschool\nRavelry: https://www.ravelry.com/people/EricaArndt\n\n****  ****  **** \nDisclosure: This is not a sponsored video.

        "description": "I cannot believe I’m making my second “call to crafters” video of 2020, but here we are.   There are SO MANY great tutorials out there. I’ll have a few posted just below, and make sure you check the comments for what other viewers prefer. Today I’m showing you 3 different mask options and 3 different strap options. Depending on what you have on hand, you can make this mask. \n---------THESE DO NOT PREVENT YOU FROM GETTING COVID 19!-----------\nEach version includes a pipe cleaner for the nose and a pocket in the lining for a filter. \n\nFor version 1, I used the following:\n   Exterior : One 9” x 7” cut quilt cotton\n   Lining : Two 9” x 4.5” cuts quilt cotton\n   Strap : Two ¼” wide 7” long elastic strips \n   Nose Frame : 6” long cut of pipe cleaner\n\nFor version 2, I used the following:\n   Exterior : One 10.5” x 7” cut quilt cotton\n   Lining : Two 10.5” x 4.5” cuts quilt cotton\n   Strap : Double fold binding, made from a 2” x 50” cut quilt cotton\n   Nose Frame : 6” long cut of pipe cleaner\n\nFor version 3, get the PDF pattern for Mask 1 from this website (scroll down, PDFs are right above Step 2... download PDF for Mask 1) : https://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Cloth-Face-Mask/?fbclid=IwAR018UdsmEiGoiZVdB7XQwoXHs-bmkKA0ED2JVsKeaqPjXSk0eUyFRajl-s\n   Exterior and Lining are made from quilt cotton.\n   Strap : 4 1”x18” cuts of knit fabric\n   Nose Frame : 4” long cut of pipe cleaner\n\nHere are some wonderful tutorials available:\n---- Lorrie Nunemaker: This version is quick and easy. Great if you need to make a lot quickly. https://youtu.be/VNvRl5AXt8I\n\n--- Dana from Made Everyday is showing LOTS of options on her Instagram account () and provides a PDF file with instructions: https://www.madeeveryday.com/fabric-face-mask-free-pattern/\n\n-- Brooke from BBBrooke on Instagram is helping those in need of facemasks connect with those who can make them.\n\n-- Amanda from a.crafty.fox on Instagram has story highlights showing how to make the masks using double gauze. \n\nMake sure to share your favorite tutorials in the comments section!\n\nTimestamps for each step in the first comment!\n\nHappy Sewing!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJoin the OklaRoots Membership for quarterly livestreams.

          "description": "I cannot believe I’m making my second “call to crafters” video of 2020, but here we are.   There are SO MANY great tutorials out there. I’ll have a few posted just below, and make sure you check the comments for what other viewers prefer. Today I’m showing you 3 different mask options and 3 different strap options. Depending on what you have on hand, you can make this mask. \n---------THESE DO NOT PREVENT YOU FROM GETTING COVID 19!-----------\nEach version includes a pipe cleaner for the nose and a pocket in the lining for a filter. \n\nFor version 1, I used the following:\n   Exterior : One 9” x 7” cut quilt cotton\n   Lining : Two 9” x 4.5” cuts quilt cotton\n   Strap : Two ¼” wide 7” long elastic strips \n   Nose Frame : 6” long cut of pipe cleaner\n\nFor version 2, I used the following:\n   Exterior : One 10.5” x 7” cut quilt cotton\n   Lining : Two 10.5” x 4.5” cuts quilt cotton\n   Strap : Double fold binding, made from a 2” x 50” cut quilt cotton\n   Nose Frame : 6” long cut of pipe cleaner\n\nFor version 3, get the PDF pattern for Mask 1 from this website (scroll down, PDFs are right above Step 2... download PDF for Mask 1) : https://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Cloth-Face-Mask/?fbclid=IwAR018UdsmEiGoiZVdB7XQwoXHs-bmkKA0ED2JVsKeaqPjXSk0eUyFRajl-s\n   Exterior and Lining are made from quilt cotton.\n   Strap : 4 1”x18” cuts of knit fabric\n   Nose Frame : 4” long cut of pipe cleaner\n\nHere are some wonderful tutorials available:\n---- Lorrie Nunemaker: This version is quick and easy. Great if you need to make a lot quickly. https://youtu.be/VNvRl5AXt8I\n\n--- Dana from Made Everyday is showing LOTS of options on her Instagram account () and provides a PDF file with instructions: https://www.madeeveryday.com/fabric-face-mask-free-pattern/\n\n-- Brooke from BBBrooke on Instagram is helping those in need of facemasks connect with those who can make them.\n\n-- Amanda from a.crafty.fox on Instagram has story highlights showing how to make the masks using double gauze. \n\nMake sure to share your favorite tutorials in the comments section!\n\nTimestamps for each step in the first comment!\n\nHappy Sewing!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJoin the OklaRoots Membership for quarterly livestreams.

        "description": "SUBSCRIBE + Click the Bell!! - https://bit.ly/2MPzFC8\nMOST POPULAR VIDEOS- http://bit.ly/popularvid\nInstagram- https://www.instagram.com/orlyshani\nMOMHOOD Podcast - http://bit.ly/momhoodshow\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n-Make sure you wash the masks before use to allow the pin holes to 'heal', otherwise the holes left by the straight pins is much larger than the .02 micro size..

        "description": "PLEASE READ IMPORTANT INFO ABOUT MAKING + WEARING MASKS ....A homemade face mask is not a replacement for medical PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) Wearing a homemade face mask does not protect you or others from the virus. It can help (which is why the CDC recommends wearing one when going to the grocery store or pharmacy) but it is only a semi-protective barrier.\nHere is a great article about the best fabrics to use when sewing a face mask:\nhttps://newsroom.wakehealth.edu/News-Releases/2020/04/Testing-Shows-Type-of-Cloth-Used-in-Homemade-Masks-Makes-a-Difference\n\nWHEN MAKING MASKS:\nUse clean, cotton fabric that is tightly woven on both sides, and sew on a clean work surface. \nWash your hands before sewing. \nDo not make masks if you are feeling sick.\n\nIF YOU WEAR A MASK IN PUBLIC:\n• When you get to your car, take the mask off-- without touching the front of the mask---and place it in a bag. You may use a fabric bag or pillowcase for this, so when you get home you can wash everything together. If you wear gloves to the store, pull those off from the inside out and place them in the bag also. \n• When you get home, WASH your hands for 20 seconds.\n• Wash the mask in a washing machine. Throw away the gloves (if they are disposable). \n• Disinfect your car by wiping down the things you touched, your steering wheel, keys, phone, credit card, doorknob to the house when you came in.\n\nINFO FOR ADDING FILTER POCKET IN THE VIDEO.\n\nPREWASH + DRY all fabrics before sewing! (so they pre-shrink)\n• Cut 2 pieces of cotton fabric 9 x 8 inches, WxH (23 x 20 cm)\n• Cut 4 ties, 18 inches long each (46 cm)\n• Finished height (after pleating) should be 3 inches tall.\n\nFIND A FREE 1-PAGE PRINTABLE PATTERN FOR THIS (using elastic around the head) HERE ON MY SITE: https://www.madeeveryday.com/fabric-face-mask-free-pattern/\n\nI've tried different styles, and this method is my favorite (with 4 stretchy ties). The mask covers the mouth and nose well, it's easy to make, and uses ties (rather than elastic) for a comfy and adjustable fit. Just cut strips of knit fabric, or cut up an old t-shirt or leggings! There's also an opening at the bottom of the mask, so a filter piece can be added in.\n\nINFO ABOUT KNIT FABRICS:\nThe best kind of knits for this will have a bit of spandex in them. Just look at the raw edge of the fabric. If it's already rolling up a bit, then it's going to work .\nTry using a stretchy soft t-shirt (not the cheap \"free T-shirt\" stuff you might have from an event). Or use a pair of worn out leggings (the Cat and Jack ones from Target work GREAT).\nAND IF IT'S NOT ROLLING UP, YOU CAN STILL USE IT! The ties won't be as stretchy, but they will still stay nice on the head because of the texture of the fabric, which doesn't slip on the hair as much as ribbon or other fabrics. Maybe cut them a little longer, 20 inches? (since they won't stretch)\n\nADDITIONAL SIZING:\nTeenager -  FABRIC: 8x8 inches, TIES: 16 inches\nChild -  FABRIC: 8x8 inches, TIES: 16 inches \nToddler - FABRIC 7x7 inches, TIES: 15 inches\n(note: these sizes are guestimates. I have not tried all of them, but they should be pretty close)\n\nI hope you're all safe and well. \nLove from Texas.\n\nWARNING: This is an educational tutorial only.

        "description": "Expert Sewer Amanda Perna guides us in this easy tutorial on how to make DIY face masks to donate to healthcare workers who are facing shortages. With the right materials this is an easy project even for beginner sewers. \nLearn #withme \n\nAmanda is a fashion designer and Project Runway alum, who started sewing face masks after she had to temporarily close her fashion studio due to the coronavirus outbreak. Amanda has been working tirelessly to make as many masks as possible and recruiting seamstresses to join her efforts. We also reached out to some of our top-tested cotton sheet brands like Parachute, Gryphon, Garnet Hill, Cuddledown, and Authenticity50, and they have generously committed to sending her fabric.\n\nHomemade masks technically are not hospital-approved, so some hospitals won’t accept the donations directly. Check with local hospitals in your area to see if they can use your homemade masks and if so, what their policies are for dropping them off.  Otherwise, healthcare professionals are making requests on social media. MasksForHeroes uses an Instagram account to post PPE requests from healthcare workers. https://www.masksforheroes.com/\nThe U.C. Berkeley School of Public Health is also compiling lists of hospitals by state that are accepting homemade masks, including instructions for dropping them off.\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/12a5YO0Z9RpHZk9Zkzl4NOj9CbjzhFfoKjPLFFC-21LU/preview?fbclid=IwAR285Vs3FqP97pmRWYW-4HIKvtxxy9hPMDVztTQjV_i40Ff2ClGIqphsdj8\n\nYou can find Amanda's pattern here. The pattern is 9\"x8\" and can be printed on a standard 8.5\" x 11\" piece of paper.https://hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/files/amanda-perna-face-mask-pattern-1585259501.pdf\n\nHere 's the step-by-step guide to sewing your own fabric face mask.\n\n**STEPS**\n00:56 Cut pattern out\n01:08 Pin pattern to fabric and cut 2 cotton fabric pieces.\n01:08 Pin pattern to interfacing to cut 2 interfacing pieces (must be non-woven).\n02:20 Place interfacing pieces on top of fabric pieces, making sure fabric right sides are facing each other.\n02:40 Measure and cut binding tape pieces so you have two 36\" strands.\n03:40 Pin fabric and interfacing pieces together to secure before sewing.\n03:58 Sew the top 9\" seam (2.5-3 stitch length is best) with ¼” seam allowance.\n04:40 Flip open with front side of fabric up and press seam flat to one side.\n05:00 Insert metal piece along seam between the 2 pieces of fabric.\n05:46 Stitch ½” rectangle that is indicated at top of pattern (with wrong sides together) to secure metal nose bridge piece.\n06:43 Flip back to right sides together, stitch bottom 9” seam\n07:49 Flip back to right side out and press bottom seam\n08:23 Use pattern to help mark pleats. Pleat the 3 pleats all in the same direction, put a pin to keep them in place.\n11:08 Find the center point of the binding and the center point of the mask and pin the binding on the mask with the mask sandwiched between the binding.\n11:55 Sew binding and repeat on the other side of the mask then press pleats.\n13:25 Finally, pat yourself on the back, because you are making a difference!\n\n**SUPPLIES**\nMask pattern\nHigh thread count cotton fabric\nNon-woven interfacing :https://www.amazon.com/s?k=nonwoven+filter+fabric&ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10055.a.31902442%5Bsrc%7C%5Bch%7C%5Blt%7C&tag=goodhousekeeping_auto-append-20&ref=nb_sb_noss_2\nBias tape, extra wide double fold, 1/2\" width\nPins\nMetal piece to secure the mask at the nose bridge. Paper clip piece or twist-tie works.\nMeasuring Tape\nScissors\nIron\nSewing machine\n\n**TIPS*\nThe best fabric for homemade masks is a tightly woven, 100% cotton fabric. Things like denim, bed sheets, and heavyweight shirts are all good options. Avoid knit fabrics (e.g. jersey T-shirts) because they create holes when they stretch.\n\nMake sure to wash and preshrink any fabric you're going to use.\n\nIf you've cut wire for the nose bridge be sure to sand down any sharp ends so the wire won't potentially pierce through the fabric or bother the wearer.\n\nFabric masks are not as effective as N95 masks, but they're still useful. The CDC advises using N95 masks for the best protection, but it says to use a bandana or scarf as a last resort if the hospital-approved masks are not available. Fabric masks are often being worn on top of N95 masks to help them last longer.
